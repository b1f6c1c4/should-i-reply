## Should I reply? (a.k.a They are just not that into you)
This is a toy program made mostly for fun and for whoever still believes in the power of playing hard-to-get in the dating scene. It does stats for your chatting history and gives you suggestions of when to reply.

Works for tg chats at https://web.telegram.org/#/im
To get more messages into stats simply scroll up the page and load more messages.
